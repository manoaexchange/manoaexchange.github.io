## Development Progress

This section shows our progress in creating the application. 

### Milestone 1

**Status: Complete**

**Date: 3/31/19-4/11/19**

Start creating mockup pages for a select few pages. We first started coding in a React application. Once we had our mockup pages created, we transferred it over to the Meteor application. Along with the mockup pages, links toward over half the pages work, but are not implemented yet. 

Pages Worked On:
* Landing page
* Sign in/Sign up pages
* User Home page
* Profile page
* Message Page
* Report page

See [Milestone 1 Project Board](https://github.com/manoaexchange/manoaexchange/projects/1) for more details.

### Milestone 2

**Status: Incomplete**

**Date: 4/12/19-**

Finish Mockup for remaining pages and implement functions of Milestone 1 pages along with a few extra functions. 

See [Milestone 2 Project Board](https://github.com/manoaexchange/manoaexchange/projects/2) for more details.
